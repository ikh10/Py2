# 🎯 Mini Python Series – Py2

Welcome to **Py2**, a mini Python project series created during my summer break! This series continues my journey to sharpen Python basics through short, purposeful projects. This series involve basic concepts and focuses on **for loop** and **functions**.

## This Py2 series include:
1. Password Strength Checker
2. Palindrome Checker
3. Countdown Timer

## Technology Used: Python 3.x

### 1. 🔐 Password Strength Checker
Analyzes how strong a password is based on character variety and length.

**Features:**
- Checks for lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Categorizes passwords as Weak, Medium, or Strong.

---

### 2. 🔁 Palindrome Checker 

A simple Python script that checks whether a given word is a palindrome — a word that reads the same forwards and backwards (like *madam*, *racecar*, or *level*).

**Features:**
- Accepts user input from the terminal
- Checks if the word is the same when reversed
- Uses clean function-based logic and slicing for reversal
